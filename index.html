                        <p>Today is a very sunny day and birds <i>chirping</i> really loud early in the morning. 
                            I woke up today and did my morning jog as usually as I needed to get out of the house and 
                            be active throughout this the Covid situation. I would be really happy to be back on my college campus <b>(UCSD)</b>.
                            <b>UCSD</b> is a beautiful campus as it is located in La Jolla california, right next to a beach. Today's weather really
                            reminded me of campus as it was always sunny and warm. Here in my home town the weather varies as we experience all four seasons.
                            After my jog, i came back and relaxed a little bit and then caught up on some lectures from my classes that are not asynchronous.
                            After hours of lectures I decided to take a break and play basketball with my friends and we ran five on five games at my old high school. 
                            Coming back from playing basketball I had to catch up on some homework and projects from my classes. Then I ended my day off by watching some youTube Videos.
                        <br>Today has been a <span style="color:red"> regular day.</span><br>

                        <p>Today was a rather mellow but sunny day and many of my neighbors were up early as well. I had a really nice conversion with my neighbors about how <b>COVID-19</b> has been for them.
                            I noticed all of my neighbors had got the vaccines already and I plan to take mine very soon. After minutes of conversion later I went for a jog as usually and happen to run into 
                            an old high school friend of mine. I decided to run with him and it brought back memories of old times when we used to run on the cross country team. After the jog, I came home to a nice 
                            breakfast made by my mom. My morning today was really chill and then I had to catch up on lectures again today. Lectures been pretty interesting, but I felt like they were longer than 
                            usually for some reason. Hours later, I decided to take a crazy long break to game with my friends. I spent about 3 hours playing <em>counter-strike</em> with my friends. One of my friend would stream and we
                            got many amazing clips on his twitch account. Overall the gaming session was really fun as it allowed me to relax and just have fun. After realizing that I have gamed to long, I had to be
                            productive and do some homework. As usual, I finished my day off with some youTube.
                           <br>Today was rather an interesting <span style="color:red"> regular day.</span><br>

                        <p>Today was a really bright day and I felt really sore for some reason. I was probably sort today because I slept really late yesterday watching an interesting documentary on youTube
                            about how the <b>COVID-19</b> vaccine worked. I was really sore, but I still decided to take a jog. The jog was short as I did not feel like jogging that much today. After the jog i came home early and 
                            made some breakfast and took a little nap. Waking from that nap I felt amazing and even more amazing my friend messaged me to go to the basketball courts at my old high school to play 
                            a few games with them. My team won a couple games, but also lost a couple games. Overall, I did not care about winning or losing as it was really fun to play with my friends. After couple of games, 
                            I came home and did some homework. I was really happy today that I have caught up with all my lectures from school. While I was doing homework, my friends decide to be really spontaneous and 
                            invited me out to hang. So I decided to go and had a really nice time as we talk for hours. Overall, I started the day off really slow, but ended really nice with some video on youTube.
                           <br>Today was a really <span style="color:red"> amazing day.</span><br>
